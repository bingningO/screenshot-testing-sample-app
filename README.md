# Android Screenshot Testing Sample Repository

This repository is designed to explore and evaluate various libraries and techniques for screenshot testing in Android. 

The codebase is primarily based on the [android-compose-codelabs](https://github.com/android/codelab-android-compose)#Theming Codelab, 
with additional modifications to integrate and test different screenshot testing libraries.

## Introduction

Screenshot testing is a powerful tool for ensuring the visual correctness of UI components in Android applications. 

This repository aims to provide a practical example of how different screenshot testing libraries can be integrated into an Android project built with Jetpack Compose.

## Screens
- **Inbox Screen**: A screen that displays a list of items.
- **Detail Screen**: A screen that displays the details of an item.
- **Animation Screen**: A screen that demonstrates several animations.
- **Setting Screen**: A screen that allows the user to change the theme of the app.

## Libraries and Tools

This repository includes configurations and examples for the following screenshot testing libraries:

- **[Roborazzi](https://github.com/takahirom/roborazzi)**: A lightweight library for generating and comparing screenshots.
- **[Compose Preview Screenshot Testing](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/compose-screenshot-testing)**: Utilizes the built-in Compose Preview to capture and compare screenshots.
